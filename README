The assignment consists of creating a program that can verify a given 9x9
sudoku solution using POSIX threads, preferably as fast as possible.

Compile with `make`, or if you prefer Clang, `CC=clang make`. Usage:

    ./sudoku_verifier <input file> <nthreads>

Some test boards are available inside the `tests/` folder; run `make -j test`
to assert the (in)validity of their solutions.

If `-pedantic` is enabled, the compiler will warn about the task buffer
declaration, since it is a GNU extension [1].
